## Load the data

Since `webr` only has limited packages we'll load the Tidy Tuesday data directly.
Click the `Run code` button at the top to load the data.

```{webr-r}
surveys <- read.csv("https://tidytuesday.weecology.org/surveys.csv")
species <- read.csv("https://tidytuesday.weecology.org/species.csv")
plots <- read.csv("https://tidytuesday.weecology.org/plots.csv")
```

Take a look at the data here using your favorite commands (e.g., `head(surveys)`).
Any commands you enter will be run right in the browser.

```{webr-r}
```

## Not all NA's are NA's

There is a species code `"NA"` for [_Neotoma albigula_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-throated_woodrat).
Try adding `na.strings = ""` to `read.csv()` for `surveys` and `species` to properly import it.
You can change them right in the code block and click `Run code` to rerun.

## Install packages

To install packages in `webr` use `webr::install()` with a vector of packages you want to install.

The following packages are currently available in `webr`:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#| class: scrolling
packages = read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/r-wasm/webr-repo/main/repo-packages")
packages$Formula
```

Install any packages you want here:

```{webr-r}
webr::install()
```

## Tidy Tuesday away!

Anything you type in this block will run when you 

```{webr-r}
```
