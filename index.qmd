## Load packages

To install packages in `webr` use `webr::install()` with a vector of packages you want to install.

The following packages are currently available in `webr`:

```{r}

```

## Load the data

Since `webr` only has limited packages so far we can't use the Tidy Tuesday package so we'll load the data directly.

```{webr-r}
packages = read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/r-wasm/webr-repo/main/repo-packages")
packages
```
