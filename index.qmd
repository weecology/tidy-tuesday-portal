## Load the data

Since `webr` only has limited packages we'll load the Tidy Tuesday data directly.

```{webr-r}
surveys <- read.csv("https://tidytuesday.weecology.org/surveys.csv")
species <- read.csv("https://tidytuesday.weecology.org/species.csv")
plots <- read.csv("https://tidytuesday.weecology.org/plots.csv")
```

## Load packages

To install packages in `webr` use `webr::install()` with a vector of packages you want to install.

The following packages are currently available in `webr`:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#| class: scrolling
packages = read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/r-wasm/webr-repo/main/repo-packages")
packages$Formula
```
